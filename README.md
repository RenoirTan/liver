# LiVer v0.2.2

[Github Repo](https://github.com/RenoirTan/liver)

This is a VSCode theme which uses colours mainly between lilac and vermillion.
It also tries to limit the use of bold and italic font styles to markup files
such as markdown.

## Liver Dark vs Liver Dark Full

Liver Dark Full is technically the original theme (in the sense that it's closer
to liver in v0.1.x). It adds font styles for certain elements such as
links, bold and italicised fonts for text in Markdown, as well as bold text for
constant variables.
In Liver Dark, all text (at least in the editor) do not have font styles,
except for links, which VSCode enthusiastically underlines for you even though
I didn't specify it to underline links. However, both themes look quite similar
side-by-side.
