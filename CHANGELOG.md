# LiVer v0.1.0 Changelog

## Version 0.0.x

Original version.

## Version 0.1.0

Decrease the saturation of:

1. violet,
2. lilac,
3. lavender,
4. blue-violet,
5. cyan,
6. mint-green

In addition, `neutral`'s hex color value has been changed from `#797979` to
`#7f7f7f` after I realised that 0xFF / 2 is 0x7F and not 0x79.

White has been darkened from `#eeeeee` to `#e3e3e3`.
